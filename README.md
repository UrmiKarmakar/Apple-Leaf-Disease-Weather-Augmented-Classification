# Apple-Leaf-Disease-Weather-Augmented-Classification
Apple leaf disease classification system enhanced with weather metadata integration. This project builds a multimodal dataset by combining leaf images with environmental features to analyze correlations and improve prediction performance. Includes data preprocessing, weather API integration, dataset merging, visualization, and ML CSV generation.

# 🍎 Apple Leaf Disease Classification with Weather-Augmented Dataset

This project builds an enhanced dataset for apple leaf disease classification by combining **leaf images** with **weather features** such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed.

The goal is to explore whether integrating environmental factors improves disease detection accuracy using Deep Learning models.
